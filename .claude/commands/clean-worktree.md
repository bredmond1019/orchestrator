# Clean Worktree — Merge a completed SDLC worktree branch into main and remove it.

## Variables

$ARGUMENTS — one of:
- `phase0-blockC`          → worktree name: `phase0-blockc`
- `phase0-blockC 3`        → worktree name: `phase0-blockc-task3`
- `phase0-blockc-task8`    → literal worktree name (already lowercased, single token)
- `phase0-blockc-task8-2`  → literal worktree name with suffix (from sdlc-task auto-increment)

The literal single-token form is output by `/sdlc-task` when it creates a suffixed worktree
(e.g. `-2`, `-3`). Pass it exactly as printed.

## Instructions

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is not provided, stop and print usage:
   ```
   Usage: /clean-worktree <block-id> [task-N]
          /clean-worktree <literal-worktree-name>
   Examples:
     /clean-worktree phase0-blockC
     /clean-worktree phase0-blockC 3
     /clean-worktree phase0-blockc-task8
     /clean-worktree phase0-blockc-task8-2
   ```

2. **Parse arguments:**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a **single token with no spaces** that is already lowercase and contains
     only letters, digits, and hyphens → treat it as the literal `worktreeName` directly.
   - Otherwise, apply the same transform as `/init-worktree`: lowercase `blockId`, append
     `-task<taskNum>` if a second token is a number. Derive `worktreeName`.
   - Always: `worktreePath = trees/<worktreeName>`
   - Extract `taskNum` from `worktreeName` for use in the task log step:
     - Pattern: `<blockid>-task<N>` or `<blockid>-task<N>-<suffix>`
     - Extract `taskNum` as the integer after the last `-task` in the name.
     - `logFile = planning/tasks/<blockId-placeholder>/reports/task<taskNum>-log.md`
     - **Note:** the actual `blockId` (with original casing) is read from the log file itself
       (`**Block:** phase0-blockC`) rather than derived from the lowercased branch name.
       Use the branch name only to locate the approximate path; then read the log's `**Block:**`
       field and use that value as the authoritative blockId for all STATUS.md path lookups.

3. **Check if the worktree exists:**
   ```bash
   git worktree list | grep <worktreePath>
   ```
   If not found, skip to step 8 (branch-only cleanup).

4. **SAFETY — Show uncommitted changes in the worktree:**
   ```bash
   git -C <worktreePath> status --short
   git -C <worktreePath> diff --stat
   ```
   If there are uncommitted changes, print:
   ```
   WARNING: The worktree has uncommitted changes (shown above).
   These will be permanently lost if the worktree is removed.
   Proceed anyway? (yes/no)
   ```
   Stop and wait for user confirmation. If the user says anything other than "yes", abort.

5. **SAFETY — Show unpushed commits on the worktree branch:**
   ```bash
   git -C <worktreePath> log --oneline main..HEAD
   ```
   Display this list clearly. These are the commits that will be merged into `main`.

6. **Merge the branch into main (fast-forward only):**

   Run from the main working tree (not from within the worktree):
   ```bash
   git merge --ff-only <worktreeName>
   ```

   **If fast-forward succeeds:** continue to step 7.

   **If fast-forward fails** (main has advanced since the worktree was created):
   - Print the divergence: `git log --oneline <worktreeName>..main` to show which commits on main are not in the worktree branch.
   - Stop. Do NOT delete the worktree or branch.
   - Print resolution options:
     ```
     Fast-forward merge failed. The worktree branch is behind main.
     The worktree at <worktreePath> has been left intact.

     To resolve, choose one of:
       Option A — Create a merge commit:
         git merge <worktreeName>

       Option B — Rebase the worktree branch onto main (from inside the worktree):
         cd <worktreePath>
         git rebase main
         cd <back to repo root>
         /clean-worktree <original-args>   ← retry after rebasing
     ```

6.5. **Apply task log (if present) — update STATUS.md and DEVLOG.md:**

   This step only applies when a task number was identified in `worktreeName`.

   ```bash
   ls <logFile> 2>/dev/null && echo "LOG_EXISTS" || echo "NO_LOG"
   grep "^\*\*Applied:\*\* false" <logFile> 2>/dev/null && echo "NOT_YET_APPLIED" || echo "ALREADY_APPLIED"
   ```

   **If log file exists AND `Applied: false`:**

   a. Read `<logFile>` in full.
   b. Extract the `**Block:**` field from the log file to get the authoritative blockId
      (e.g. `phase0-blockC` with original casing). Use this value — not the lowercased
      branch name — for all `planning/tasks/<blockId>/` path lookups.
   c. If `## STATUS.md — Block Status` section is present → flip the block's Status column
      in `planning/STATUS.md` progress table to the value specified (e.g. "In progress").
      Omit this sub-step if that section is absent from the log file.
   d. Apply `## STATUS.md — Current Focus Line` → replace the `**Current focus:**` line in
      `planning/STATUS.md` with the exact string from the log.
   e. Apply `## STATUS.md — Last Updated Line` → replace the `**Last updated:**` line in
      `planning/STATUS.md` with the exact string from the log.
   f. Apply `## STATUS.md — Block Notes Column` → update the Notes column of the matching
      block row in `planning/STATUS.md` with the text from the log.
   g. Prepend the **content under** `## DEVLOG Entry` to `DEVLOG.md` — this means
      everything from the `## YYYY-MM-DD` date header line onward, NOT the `## DEVLOG Entry`
      section header itself. Insert it immediately after the `# DEVLOG —` header line
      (which is below the YAML frontmatter block, keeping the frontmatter at the very top of the file),
      preserving a blank line between the new entry and the one below.
   h. Edit `<logFile>`: change `**Applied:** false` → `**Applied:** true`.
   i. Stage and commit these three files only:
      ```bash
      git add planning/STATUS.md DEVLOG.md <logFile>
      git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
      chore: apply task log for <stem>
      EOF
      )"
      ```
   j. Report: "STATUS.md and DEVLOG.md updated from task log."

   **If `Applied: true`:** report "Task log already applied — skipping STATUS/DEVLOG update."

   **If log file not found:** report "No task log found — STATUS/DEVLOG not updated.
   If this task was run with /sdlc-task, check that the pipeline completed its wrap-up stage."

7. **Remove the worktree and delete the branch:**
   ```bash
   git worktree remove <worktreePath> --force
   git worktree prune
   git branch -D <worktreeName>
   ```

8. **Branch-only cleanup** (worktree directory not found, but branch may still exist):
   ```bash
   git branch --list <worktreeName>
   ```
   If the branch exists:
   - Show any commits not yet on main: `git log --oneline main..<worktreeName>`
   - Delete the branch: `git branch -D <worktreeName>`
   If neither worktree nor branch exists, report: "Nothing to clean — '<worktreeName>' does not exist."

9. **Verify cleanup — run these and display output:**
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   git branch --list <worktreeName>
   git log --oneline -6
   ```

10. **Report one of:**
    - **Success:** "Worktree '<worktreeName>' merged and cleaned. Branch deleted. Pipeline commits are now on main."
    - **Merge failed:** "Fast-forward failed. Worktree left intact at <worktreePath>. See options above."
    - **Branch-only cleanup:** "Worktree directory not found. Branch '<worktreeName>' deleted (if it existed)."
    - **Already clean:** "Nothing to clean — '<worktreeName>' does not exist."

## Notes

- **Merge before delete.** This command never deletes the worktree or branch until the merge succeeds. Work is preserved until confirmed safe.
- **Fast-forward only** is the correct default for this pipeline: worktrees branch from `main` at init time, run the full pipeline, and then merge back. If `main` has advanced concurrently (e.g., a hotfix), `--ff-only` fails with a clear error rather than silently creating a merge commit.
- **Uncommitted changes** in the worktree are unusual — the SDLC pipeline commits after each stage. If they appear, it likely means the pipeline was interrupted mid-stage.
- Run this command from the **main repo session** (CWD: repo root), not from inside the worktree.
- **Task log (sdlc-task only):** When a task was run with `/sdlc-task`, the worktree branch contains a `task<N>-log.md` file instead of STATUS.md/DEVLOG.md changes. Step 6.5 reads that file and applies the updates to main after the merge. Always merge tasks in task-number order so STATUS.md's "Current focus" ends up pointing to the right next task.
- **Suffix worktrees:** If `/sdlc-task` created `phase0-blockc-task8-2` (due to a collision), pass the full name as a single argument: `/clean-worktree phase0-blockc-task8-2`. The task log is still found at `planning/tasks/phase0-blockC/reports/task8-log.md` (based on the task number extracted from the branch name).
