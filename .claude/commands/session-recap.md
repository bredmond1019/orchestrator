# Session Recap — Summarize recent work and current standing before starting a session.

Reads the most recent DEVLOG entries and STATUS.md to produce a tight briefing: what was
completed recently, where work left off, and the exact next command to run. Use this at the
start of a coding session before doing anything else.

## Instructions

1. Read `DEVLOG.md`. Focus on the three most recent entries (identified by `## YYYY-MM-DD`
   headings). Extract: what was built or changed, any decisions made, and any explicit
   "left off at" or "next step" notes the author wrote.

2. Read `planning/STATUS.md`. Extract:
   - Current focus block
   - Which blocks are `in_progress`, `done`, and `not_started`
   - Last updated date

3. If a task spec exists for the current focus block at
   `planning/tasks/phaseN-blockX/tasks.md`, read it. Identify:
   - Which steps are marked done (have ✅)
   - Which steps remain
   - Any notes in the `## Notes` section

4. Check `planning/tasks/phaseN-blockX/reports/` for any existing pipeline reports for the current
   block (e.g. `implement.md`, `task3-test.md`). Note which pipeline steps have been completed
   (have a report file) and which haven't.

5. Output the briefing in this exact format — keep it under 300 words:

---

## Recent Work
<2–4 bullet points from the latest DEVLOG entries — what was built, changed, or decided.
Use the author's own language where possible.>

## Where We Left Off
<One paragraph. State: current block, last completed pipeline step (based on report files
present), last completed spec task (based on ✅ markers), and anything explicitly noted
as "in flight" or "next" in the DEVLOG.>

## Remaining Spec Tasks
<Numbered list of un-checked (no ✅) steps from the current task spec.
If the spec is missing, say so. If all steps are done, say "All steps marked complete.">

## Next Pipeline Step
<Single line: the exact command to run next, with the full argument.>
Example: `/test planning/tasks/phase0-blockC/tasks.md 2`
If the block is complete: `Run /log-work to wrap up, then /start-block for the next block.`

---

Do not read any source code files. Do not run any commands. This is read-only.

## Context / Files to Read

- `DEVLOG.md` (last 3 entries)
- `planning/STATUS.md`
- `planning/tasks/phaseN-blockX/tasks.md` (current block's spec, if it exists)
- `planning/tasks/phaseN-blockX/reports/` (directory listing to check which step reports exist)
