# Start Block — Mark a block as in-progress in STATUS.md.

## Variables

$ARGUMENTS — optional block identifier to start (e.g. `phase1-block2`). If omitted, defaults to the first block that is not `done` in STATUS.md.

## Execution Model

Spawn a Haiku subagent (Agent tool, `model: "haiku"`) to execute all steps below.
Pass the resolved `$ARGUMENTS` value and the complete Instructions section in the subagent prompt.
Return the subagent's result to the user.

## Instructions

1. Read `planning/STATUS.md`.
2. Identify the target block:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, find that block by identifier. If not found, say so and stop.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is omitted, find the first block that is not `done`.
3. Check preconditions:
   - If the block is already `in_progress`, report that and stop.
   - If the block is `done`, report that and stop.
   - If any block that must precede this one (all blocks above it in the sequence) is not `done`, report which ones are incomplete and stop — do not skip the sequence.
4. Update the block's status to `in_progress` in STATUS.md. Preserve all other content and formatting.
5. Update the **Current focus** line to reflect this block.
6. Bump the **Last updated** date.
7. Write the updated STATUS.md.

## Context / Files to Read
