# Memory — orchestrator

Repo-scoped **durable memory**: episodic notes, operator preferences, and superseded facts that
must survive a handoff and travel with the repo. Committed and portable — distinct from the global
`~/.claude/.../memory/` auto-memory (which is operator-level and stays on one machine).

Use this for project facts worth remembering across sessions. Promote durable "how it works"
knowledge to `knowledge.md`; promote settled choices to `decisions/`. Do not duplicate the global
auto-memory here.

## Notes

_Dated episodic entries — what was tried, what was decided in-flight, what to remember next time._

_No entries yet — the first distillation pass over this repo's archives lands in HQ Restructure Block Q.4._

## Preferences

_Project-specific preferences (tooling, style, workflow) the operator has expressed._
