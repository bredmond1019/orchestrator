Started Phase 0 Block C (test infra + core hardening), completing Task 1: added `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `httpx`, `freezegun`, and `pytest-env` to `pyproject.toml`'s dev dependency group, ran `uv sync`, and scaffolded the test directory tree (`tests/` with `core/`, `database/`, `api/`, `services/` sub-packages and a stub `conftest.py`) plus a `pytest.ini` at the repo root. Block A tasks 3–9 were intentionally paused — those are personal/manual tasks (LinkedIn, GitHub triage, site work) that can't be delegated to an agent; Block C was pulled forward because it is fully agent-executable and has no dependency on the Block A personal tasks. Also created new slash commands `implement` and `review-task` (and updated related agents) to support structured task execution and review going forward. Next step: run `/review-task planning/tasks/phase0-blockC.md 1` to verify Task 1 before proceeding to Task 2 (fix `GenericRepository.exists()`).

## 2026-06-05

Generated a full suite of architecture review documents in `docs/architecture_review/` — one per core abstraction: `workflow.md`, `task_context.md`, `agent_node.md`, `parallel_node.md`, `router_node.md`, `workflow_schema.md`, `workflow_validator.md`, and `prompt_manager.md`. These are the output of Phase 0 Block A, Task 1 (read `workflow.py` and `task.py`) and the start of Task 2 (read `AgentNode` and support nodes). Task 1 is complete; Task 2 is in progress — the node docs are generated, covering `AgentNode`, `ParallelNode`, `RouterNode`, `WorkflowSchema`, and `WorkflowValidator`, which spans most of Task 2's reading scope. Also did a significant planning session: updated the Master Plan and Agentic Engineering Projects plan with important architectural and strategic detail, all captured as new entries in `planning/DECISIONS.md`. No code changed; all work this session was documentation, planning, and codebase orientation.
