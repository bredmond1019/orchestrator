## 2026-06-10 (Block B private face — Mac Mini Tailscale unattended access)

Set up the Mac Mini's private face and connected it to my MacBook Pro. Installed the Tailscale standalone app, signed in, and put the Mini on my tailnet as `brandons-mac-mini` (`100.104.113.100`) with MagicDNS; then joined the MacBook Pro to the same tailnet and confirmed I can SSH into the Mini from it. The real work was making access survive a reboot or crash with nobody touching the machine. macOS doesn't support true before-login Tailscale — it can't run as a system service yet (tailscale#987) — and more decisively, **FileVault gates all networking at the pre-boot unlock screen**: until the disk is unlocked at the physical machine, the OS hasn't booted and nothing (SSH, Screen Sharing, VNC, Tailscale) can be running. VNC doesn't get around this for the same reason — it's an in-OS tool and the unlock screen sits below the OS. So unattended recovery meant **disabling FileVault, enabling auto-login for brandon, and turning on Tailscale's launch- and connect-on-login**. Verified end to end: rebooted the Mini and reconnected over SSH from the MacBook Pro without touching the box. The Mini's power settings were already correct for a headless machine (no system sleep, auto-restart after power failure, wake-on-network) and Remote Login was already on. Accepted tradeoff: FileVault is off, so the disk isn't encrypted at rest — acceptable because the threat model here is network exposure (handled by Tailscale + zero open ports), not theft of a physically-secured home box; the encryption-preserving alternatives (`fdesetup authrestart` for planned reboots, an IP-KVM for unplanned crashes) were considered and deferred. **Still to connect to the tailnet:** my remaining devices (Pixel tablet and phone; Kindle TBD), the private tooling itself (orchestration API, Celery, personal knowledge feed) once those services are running, and a **Claude Code remote-trigger path** so I can kick off agent runs on the Mini from other devices over Tailscale and/or via webhooks. Infrastructure/ops work on the Mini — no repository code changed this session.

## 2026-06-10 (Block B public face + SDLC block orchestration)

Two threads landed today. First, the **public face of Block B is done**: `learn-agentic-ai.com` is now live to the public, served from the Mac Mini through a **Cloudflare Tunnel** with Cloudflare DNS in front. The tunnel approach means no inbound ports are opened on the Mini — the site is reachable by anyone with the URL while the box itself stays closed, which is the right shape for a privacy-first harness. This completes the site-revival half of Block B; the remaining work is the **private face** — installing Tailscale on the Mini and all my devices (Pixel tablet, phone, Kindle, laptop) and putting the personal knowledge feed, orchestration API, and Celery behind it with no open ports. Per the two-face architecture (DECISIONS D23), Tailscale alone can't serve the public site, which is exactly why the public side went through Cloudflare. I'll work Block B (Tailscale) and Block D (shared services) in parallel from here. Second, I built `.claude/workflows/sdlc-block.js` — a block-level SDLC orchestration workflow that drives an entire `planning/tasks/<blockId>/tasks.md` to completion by fanning out many parallel `/sdlc-task` pipelines, each in its own git worktree, across dependency-ordered waves. An Opus analysis agent proposes a dependency graph with evidence and an additive-file allow-list; deterministic JS computes the topological waves and conflict serialization; each wave runs with bounded retries plus failure triage (RETRYABLE → clean-slate re-run, MAJOR → escalate and poison only the dependent subtree); merges happen in task-number order with additive-only union fallback; and STATUS/DEVLOG are applied exactly once at the end. The same commit set also ported three-tier model assignment (Opus for planning, Sonnet for review/merge, Haiku for mechanical steps) into `sdlc-run` and `sdlc-task`, and added the `sdlc-orchestration` / `sdlc-dynamic-workflows` docs. This is the agentic harness machinery that actually ran Block C — tooling, not a planning block.

## 2026-06-09 (task 14 — validate)

Ran the full validation pass for Phase 0 Block C: executed `uv run pytest --collect-only` and `uv run pytest -v` to confirm the entire test suite collects and passes with zero failures and zero errors, and verified the four import checks (`from main import app`, `from worker.config import celery_app`, `from database.session import Base, db_session`, `from database.repository import GenericRepository`) all run cleanly without triggering connection attempts. All acceptance criteria from the Block C task spec were confirmed met: the SQLAlchemy 2.x `AttributeError` regression test passes, the ghost-row test correctly shows an empty `Event` table when `send_task` raises, `TaskContext.get_node_output("MissingNode")` raises a `KeyError` with the diagnostic message, `WorkflowValidator` correctly detects cycles and unreachable nodes, `Workflow.run()` handles linear and router-branch pipelines in tests, `ParallelNode` documents the known shared-context gap with a "fixed in Project E" comment, `PromptManager` tests run against a fixture template without touching real prompts, and the full `GenericRepository` CRUD suite passes on in-memory SQLite. The initial test run returned a FAILED verdict on attempt 1, which was resolved before review; the review returned a PASS verdict on the first submission. This closes all 14 tasks in Phase 0 Block C — the orchestration framework now has a trustworthy, fully tested core before any client-facing workflow is built on it. Next: Phase 0, Block D — Shared services + first scaffold (pgvector, Embedding/Transcript/Search/Chunking services; scaffold Project A).

## 2026-06-09 (task 13 — prepare the LinkedIn visibility post)

Drafted the Block C LinkedIn visibility post in `planning/` covering why an untested orchestration core is a production liability and how the four bugs found in Block C — the SQLAlchemy 2.x `AttributeError` in `GenericRepository.exists()`, the ghost-row risk from committing before `send_task`, the import-time side effects in `session.py` and `worker/config.py`, and the silent router `KeyError` — each had concrete failure modes that could hit users. The post follows the public-narrative rule (subject-on-you throughout, no company names) and frames each bug around what could go wrong in production before presenting the fix. The initial test run failed (FAILED verdict on attempt 1), which was resolved before review; the review returned a PASS verdict on the first submission. Pipeline ran: implement → test(#1 FAILED) → review(#1 PASS) → document. No architectural decisions were made; this was a drafting task over Block C's bug narrative. Next: Task 14 — validation (run the full test suite and import checks, confirm all acceptance criteria are met).

## 2026-06-08 (task 12 — write `GenericRepository` CRUD tests)

Expanded `tests/database/test_repository.py` with the full CRUD test suite for `GenericRepository`. A minimal `TestModel` was defined in the test file (avoiding dependency on the `Event` model) and backed by an in-memory SQLite engine via the session-scoped `db_engine` fixture from `conftest.py`. Tests covered `create()`, `get()`, `get_all()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `get_latest()`, `count()`, and the fixed `exists()` method — including the regression test ensuring the SQLAlchemy 2.x `AttributeError` is no longer raised. The initial test run failed due to a fixture scoping issue (the `db_session` fixture conflicted with the module-level `db_session` name imported from `database.session`), which was resolved by renaming the fixture. Review returned a PASS verdict on the first submission after the fix was in place. Next: Task 13 — Prepare the LinkedIn visibility post.

## 2026-06-08 (task 11 — write `PromptManager` service tests)

Implemented `tests/services/test_prompt_loader.py` with full coverage of the `PromptManager` service using a temporary directory fixture to avoid any dependency on real `app/prompts/` files. Tests cover correct Jinja2 template rendering with variable substitution, YAML frontmatter parsing when the `PromptManager` exposes metadata, a missing template name raising a clear `FileNotFoundError` or `KeyError`, and a template with an undefined variable raising Jinja2's `UndefinedError` rather than silently producing an empty string. The test run initially failed due to a test collection issue that was resolved before the review cycle. The review returned a PASS verdict on the first attempt with no required fixes. Next: Task 12 — Write `GenericRepository` CRUD tests.

---

## 2026-06-08 (task 10 — write `ParallelNode` unit tests)

Implemented `tests/core/test_nodes_parallel.py` covering the full `ParallelNode` behavior: all parallel nodes run and write unique keys to `task_context`, concurrent execution is verified, and exception propagation from a failing parallel node is tested. A key finding was the known design gap where parallel nodes write directly to the shared `task_context` and the results list is discarded — the test documents current behavior with an explicit comment noting this is deferred to Project E where parallelism is first genuinely needed. The test(#1) run initially failed due to a threading timing sensitivity in the concurrency assertion, which was resolved before review. The review passed on the first verdict with no required fixes, validating that the test suite accurately captures both working behavior and the documented gap without introducing false failures. Next: Task 11 — Write `PromptManager` service tests.

## 2026-06-08 (task 9 — write `BaseRouter` and `RouterNode` unit tests)

Implemented the full `BaseRouter` and `RouterNode` unit test suite in `tests/core/test_nodes_router.py`. Tests cover `BaseRouter.process()` writing `{"next_node": <name>}` to `task_context.nodes`, first-match-wins behavior when multiple routes could match, fallback node selection when no routes match, the no-fallback/no-match case returning `None`, `RouterNode.determine_next_node()` returning `None` being correctly skipped, and the `KeyError` propagation from `task_context.get_node_output("Missing")` flowing out with a clear diagnostic message rather than being swallowed by `route()`. The initial test run failed due to import path issues, which were resolved before review. The review returned a PASS verdict on the first attempt. Next: Task 10 — Write `ParallelNode` unit tests.

## 2026-06-08 (session 7)

Completed Task 8 of Phase 0 Block C: wrote `Workflow.run()` unit tests in `tests/core/test_workflow.py`. The tests cover the full set of scenarios from the task spec: a linear three-node pipeline verifying that each stub node's output lands in `task_context.nodes` in the correct order; a router workflow that branches on prior node output and asserts only the correct branch ran; `event_schema` parsing asserting that a raw dict is converted to the Pydantic schema object before `run()` begins; `node_context` logging verified via `caplog` for both node start and finish messages; a node that raises `RuntimeError` asserting the exception propagates out of `run()`; and a check that `task_context.metadata` is cleaned up after a completed run. The initial test run failed on the first attempt (FAILED verdict), which triggered a fix pass; the review verdict was PASS on attempt 1 after the fix. Pipeline ran: implement → test(#1 FAILED) → review(#1 PASS) → document. No new architectural decisions were made; this was a targeted coverage exercise over the existing `Workflow.run()` execution loop. Next: Task 9 — write `BaseRouter` and `RouterNode` unit tests.

## 2026-06-08 (session 6)

Completed Task 7 of Phase 0 Block C: wrote `WorkflowValidator` unit tests in `tests/core/test_validate.py`. The tests cover all the required scenarios from the task spec: a valid linear workflow (A → B → C) passes with no error; cycle detection raises `ValueError` with "cycle" in the message; an unreachable node raises `ValueError` with "unreachable" in the message; a non-router node with multiple connections raises `ValueError`; a router node with multiple connections passes. Direct tests of the private helpers `_has_cycle()` and `_get_reachable_nodes()` were also included to lock down the validator's graph-traversal internals. Stub `Node` subclasses (3–4 lines each) were defined in the test file to satisfy the `Node` ABC without introducing logic. The initial test run failed (FAILED verdict on the first attempt), which triggered a fix pass; the review verdict was PASS on attempt 1 after the fix. Pipeline ran: implement → test(#1 FAILED) → review(#1 PASS) → document. No architectural decisions were made; this was a straightforward coverage exercise over the existing `WorkflowValidator` public API. Next: Task 8 — write `Workflow.run()` unit tests.

## 2026-06-08 (session 5)

Completed Task 6 of Phase 0 Block C: wrote unit tests for `TaskContext` and `WorkflowSchema`. `tests/core/test_task.py` was expanded with tests covering `TaskContext` creation with `event`, `nodes`, and `metadata` fields; `update_node()` for single-key, multi-key, and merge-into-existing-key scenarios; and `get_node_output()` for both the present-node and missing-node branches (the latter already covered by Task 5). `tests/core/test_schema.py` was created with tests covering `NodeConfig` default values (`connections=[]`, `is_router=False`) and override values, `WorkflowSchema` construction with stub `Node` subclasses asserting `start`, `nodes`, and `event_schema` are stored correctly, and the `is_router=True` flag round-trip. The initial test run failed (FAILED verdict), which triggered a fix pass before the final review — review verdict was PASS on attempt 1 after the fix. The pipeline ran implement → test(#1 FAILED) → review(#1 PASS) → document. No architectural decisions were made during this task; the implementation was a straightforward coverage exercise over existing public API. Next: Task 7 — write `WorkflowValidator` unit tests.

## 2026-06-08 (session 4)

Completed Task 5 of Phase 0 Block C: fixed the router key coupling bug by adding `TaskContext.get_node_output(node_name)` as an additive helper in `app/core/task.py`. The original issue was that router nodes accessing `task_context.nodes["SomeNode"]` raised a bare `KeyError` with no context about which router needed the output or what the workflow ordering problem was. The fix raises a descriptive `KeyError` that names the missing node and lists all nodes completed so far, making workflow ordering errors immediately diagnosable. The change is strictly additive — existing `customer_care` router nodes are untouched per CLAUDE.md Rule 3. Also fixed the module docstring position in `task.py` (moved above imports per style rules). 9 tests were written in `tests/core/test_task.py` covering both the missing-node and present-node branches; all 14 tests in the suite pass. The initial test run failed on a ruff violation (pre-existing docstring position issue), which was resolved in the same pipeline run; review verdict was PASS on the first attempt. Pylint false-positive `E1101 no-member` errors from Pydantic `Field` annotations are suppressed with inline comments — a pre-existing pattern in this file. Docs were updated to reflect the new method. Next: Task 6 — write unit tests for `TaskContext` and `WorkflowSchema`.

## 2026-06-08 (session 3)

Completed and documented Task 4 of Phase 0 Block C: fixed the ghost-row bug in `app/api/endpoint.py`. The original code called `repository.create()` (which committed the `Event` row immediately) before `celery_app.send_task()` — meaning a Redis failure would leave an orphaned, unprocessable row in the DB. The fix stages the row with `session.add()` + `session.flush()` (assigns `event.id` without committing), enqueues the Celery task, and only commits on success; if `send_task` raises, the `db_session()` generator's existing rollback path cleans up automatically. The endpoint now bypasses `GenericRepository.create()` for this two-phase commit pattern, which is intentional — the generic method doesn't model the enqueue dependency. SDLC pipeline ran cleanly: implement → test → review → document, with reports landing in `planning/tasks/phase0-blockC/reports/`. Also extended `pyproject.toml` to exclude the reference-only `customer_care` workflow files from ruff and pylint checks — these files are frozen and should not generate lint noise. Additionally, reorganized the `/planning/tasks/` directory from a flat layout into per-block subdirectories (e.g. `phase0-blockC/tasks.md` + `phase0-blockC/reports/`) and updated SDLC commands and workflows to match the new file organization. All four bug fixes from Block C's task spec are now done and documented. Next: Tasks 5–12, the comprehensive unit test suite for `TaskContext`, `WorkflowSchema`, `WorkflowValidator`, `Workflow.run()`, `BaseRouter`/`RouterNode`, `ParallelNode`, `PromptManager`, and `GenericRepository` CRUD.

## 2026-06-08 (session 2)

Ran the full SDLC pipeline (implement → test → review → fix → document) on Phase 0, Block C, Task 3: fixed the import-time side effects in `app/database/session.py` and `app/worker/config.py`. `session.py` previously called `create_engine()` at import time (line 15), which caused a live DB connection attempt any time the module was imported in tests or other non-production contexts. Replaced the module-level `engine` and `SessionLocal` with a `_ENGINE = None` sentinel and a lazy `_get_engine()` initialiser, so the engine is only created on first use. `worker/config.py` previously called `Celery("tasks")` followed by `celery_app.config_from_object(get_celery_config())` at import time — the `config_from_object` call silently produced a malformed broker URL if `REDIS_URL` or `PROJECT_NAME` were unset. Replaced with a single `Celery(...)` constructor call passing broker/backend/serializer config as kwargs, which does not attempt a connection. Expanded `tests/conftest.py` with session-scoped `db_engine` and function-scoped `db_session` SQLite fixtures required by the test suite. Initial test run returned FAIL on ruff (73 pre-existing issues across the whole codebase, all unrelated to Task 3) and pylint (exit 30, pre-existing violations in untouched files); the two Task 3 files themselves rated 10.00/10 after a fix pass that renamed `_engine` → `_ENGINE` (C0103), added an inline `# pylint: disable=global-statement` (W0603), and removed trailing whitespace (C0303). Final review verdict: PASS — all 10 acceptance criteria met, 3/3 pytest tests passing, import checks clean. Docs updated in `docs/api-reference.md` (lazy `_get_engine()` documented) and `docs/app-architecture-overview.md` (stale `SessionLocal` reference removed). Also created the `sdlc-run.js` Claude Code workflow (and refined it) to automate the full implement→test→review→document→wrap-up cycle for future tasks.

## 2026-06-08

Ran the full SDLC pipeline (implement → test → review → document) on Phase 0, Block C, Task 2: fixed the `GenericRepository.exists()` SQLAlchemy 2.x compatibility bug in `app/database/repository.py`, replacing the legacy `self.model.query.filter_by(**kwargs).exists()` pattern (which raises `AttributeError` in SQLAlchemy 2.x) with the correct `self.session.query(self.model).filter_by(**kwargs).first() is not None`. Wrote three regression tests in `tests/database/test_repository.py` using a self-contained `_SimpleModel` backed by SQLite (avoiding the PostgreSQL UUID type incompatibility that would block SQLite-based tests). All 3 tests pass. Review verdict: PASS. Docs were patched in `docs/api-reference.md` to reflect the corrected `exists()` signature. Also logged Task 1 as fully reviewed and complete — the pytest deps + test scaffold from the 2026-06-05 session passed review without issues (commit 602da5b). Additionally, the full SDLC slash command set was built out this sprint: new commands for project initialization (`/new-project`, `/scaffold-project`), session orientation (`/recap`, `/status`, `/process-tasks`), block setup (`/start-block`), and the complete pipeline (`/generate-tasks`, `/breakdown`, `/implement`, `/update-task`, `/commit`, `/test`, `/review-task`, `/document`, `/log-work`). The entire SDLC workflow is now documented end-to-end in `docs/sdlc-workflow.md`. Next: Task 3 — fix import-time side effects in `app/database/session.py` and `app/worker/config.py`.

## 2026-06-05 (session 2)

Started Phase 0 Block C (test infra + core hardening), completing Task 1: added `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `httpx`, `freezegun`, and `pytest-env` to `pyproject.toml`'s dev dependency group, ran `uv sync`, and scaffolded the test directory tree (`tests/` with `core/`, `database/`, `api/`, `services/` sub-packages and a stub `conftest.py`) plus a `pytest.ini` at the repo root. Block A tasks 3–9 were intentionally paused — those are personal/manual tasks (LinkedIn, GitHub triage, site work) that can't be delegated to an agent; Block C was pulled forward because it is fully agent-executable and has no dependency on the Block A personal tasks. Also created new slash commands `implement` and `review-task` (and updated related agents) to support structured task execution and review going forward. Next step: run `/review-task planning/tasks/phase0-blockC.md 1` to verify Task 1 before proceeding to Task 2 (fix `GenericRepository.exists()`).

## 2026-06-05

Generated a full suite of architecture review documents in `docs/architecture_review/` — one per core abstraction: `workflow.md`, `task_context.md`, `agent_node.md`, `parallel_node.md`, `router_node.md`, `workflow_schema.md`, `workflow_validator.md`, and `prompt_manager.md`. These are the output of Phase 0 Block A, Task 1 (read `workflow.py` and `task.py`) and the start of Task 2 (read `AgentNode` and support nodes). Task 1 is complete; Task 2 is in progress — the node docs are generated, covering `AgentNode`, `ParallelNode`, `RouterNode`, `WorkflowSchema`, and `WorkflowValidator`, which spans most of Task 2's reading scope. Also did a significant planning session: updated the Master Plan and Agentic Engineering Projects plan with important architectural and strategic detail, all captured as new entries in `planning/DECISIONS.md`. No code changed; all work this session was documentation, planning, and codebase orientation.
